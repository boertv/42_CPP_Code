// deque? put the stuff in there at the start (with checks?) and then parse it for calc
		// OR put only the current calc in there (and use size() for interpreting (2 vs 3))
		// AND ALSO MAYBE have a container of 'work mem' to put the result and all the temp numbers (e.g. 2 4 - 2 4 - 2 4 - ... - - ...)
